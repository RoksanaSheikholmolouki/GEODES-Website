## About the GEODES Laboratory

The **GEODES Laboratory** (GEOmatics Dedicated to Exploration of Space) is led by **Myriam Lemelin**, Professor in the Applied Geomatics Department at the **University of Sherbrooke** (Quebec, Canada) and Canada Research Chair in Northern and Planetary Geological Remote Sensing. Our laboratory focuses on remote sensing of geology, ice, and lunar soil properties, as well as those of asteroids and the planet Mars in support of space exploration missions. We also study the geology and soil properties of the Canadian Arctic as an analogue region to Mars, within the context of climate change.
